# Bubble Creatures - Simulated Evolution Environment
This program creates a population of "bubble creatures" that consume food tha they run into. When bubbles are recently fed they have the ability to reproduce themselves. Each bubble is given an initial set of characterstics such as size, speed, and direction which collectively determine their health decay rate and overall lifespan. The speed * radius of a bubble is ultimately what determines the rate of heatlh decay. For larger bubbles to surive they must be born with a lower speed, otherwise they die out very fast. Their larger size means an extended reach for food, but their slower speed means they are less likely to get to food quickly. With smaller bubbles it is pretty much the opposite.

In the end, the manipulation of the food supply ultimately determines who survives and who doesn't. Depending on how much food is allowed to be generated, different outcomes can be obtained which can be seen below.
